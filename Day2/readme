The **Fibonacci sequence** is a series of numbers where each number is the **sum of the two preceding ones**. It usually starts like this:

```
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...
```

Hereâ€™s how it works:

- Start with **0** and **1**
- Then:  
  - 0 + 1 = 1  
  - 1 + 1 = 2  
  - 1 + 2 = 3  
  - 2 + 3 = 5  
  - 3 + 5 = 8  
  ...and so on.

This sequence is named after **Leonardo of Pisa**, also known as **Fibonacci**, who introduced it to Europe in the 13th century through his book *Liber Abaci*.

### Where it's used:
- Nature (flower petals, pinecones, shells)
- Computer algorithms
- Art & architecture (via the Golden Ratio, which is related to Fibonacci numbers)
- Stock market analysis (some traders use Fibonacci retracements)
