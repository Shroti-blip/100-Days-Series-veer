
**LCM** stands for **Least Common Multiple**.  
It's the **smallest positive number** that is **divisible by two or more numbers**.

### ✨ Example:  
Let’s find the **LCM of 4 and 5**.

- Multiples of 4: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, ...
- Multiples of 5: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, ...

👉 Common multiples: 20, 40, ...  
👉 **LCM = 20**

🔁 Common Methods to Find LCM:
1. Listing Multiples (Basic Method)
List multiples of both numbers and find the first common one.

Example:
LCM of 6 and 8
Multiples of 6 = 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, ...
Multiples of 8 = 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, ...
LCM = 24

2. Prime Factorization Method
Break down both numbers into their prime factors, then take the highest powers of all primes involved.

Example:
LCM of 12 and 15

12 = 2² × 3

15 = 3 × 5

LCM = 2² × 3 × 5 = 60



### 📌 Formula (Using GCD):
3. You can calculate LCM using this formula://for coding

LCM(a,b)= ∣a×b∣ /GCD(a,b)
​


### ✅ Example:
For `a = 12`, `b = 18`
- GCD(12, 18) = 6
- LCM(12, 18) = (12 × 18) / 6 = **36**
