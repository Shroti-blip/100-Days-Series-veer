**Purpose:**  
To count the total number of digits present in a number.

**Logic:**  
- Start with `count = 0`.
- Divide the number by `10` repeatedly.
- After each division, increment `count` by `1`.
- Stop when the number becomes `0`.
- The final value of `count` is the number of digits.

**Example:**  
For number `584`:
```
584 Ã· 10 â†’ 58 â†’ count = 1
58 Ã· 10 â†’ 5 â†’ count = 2
5 Ã· 10 â†’ 0 â†’ count = 3
```
Result: **3 digits**
