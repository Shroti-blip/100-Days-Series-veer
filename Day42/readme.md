# Matrix Transpose

This project implements a simple program to compute the **transpose** of a matrix.

---

## ðŸ“š What is Matrix Transpose?

The **transpose** of a matrix is formed by flipping it over its diagonal.  
If `matrix[i][j]` is an element, then after transposing:  
`transpose[j][i] = matrix[i][j]`.

Example:
```

Original:
1 2
3 4
Transpose:
1 3
2 4

```

---

## ðŸ§  Logic

1. Input the matrix.
2. Create a new matrix to store the transpose.
3. Loop through rows and columns:
   - Set `transpose[j][i] = matrix[i][j]`.
4. Print the result.

## âœ¨ Output Example

```

Input:
1 2 3
4 5 6

Transpose:
1 4
2 5
3 6

```
