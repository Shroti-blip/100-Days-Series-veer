# ðŸ’Ž Diamond Pattern with Numbers â€“ Theory

This program is designed to print a symmetrical **diamond-shaped pattern using numbers**. Itâ€™s a classic example in Java to understand **nested loops**, **pattern logic**, and **number sequencing**.

## ðŸ§  Core Concepts

### 1. **Pattern Structure**

The diamond is divided into two halves:

* **Upper Half:** Builds the top part including the middle row.
* **Lower Half:** Mirrors the upper half (excluding the middle row).

Each row in the pattern follows a structure:

* **Leading Spaces:** To align the numbers and create the diamond shape.
* **Increasing Numbers:** Starting from 1 up to the row number.
* **Decreasing Numbers:** From (row number - 1) back to 1.

### 2. **Looping Logic**

* **Outer Loop:** Controls the number of rows.
* **Inner Loops:**

  * First loop prints spaces.
  * Second loop prints ascending numbers.
  * Third loop prints descending numbers.

### 3. **Why It Matters**

* Strengthens understanding of **loop nesting**.
* Enhances control over output formatting.
* Helps develop logic for creating complex visual patterns using code.

* Use nested loops effectively.
* Control whitespace and alignment in console output.
* Generate mirrored and symmetrical patterns.
* Strengthen problem-solving and logical thinking in programming.
