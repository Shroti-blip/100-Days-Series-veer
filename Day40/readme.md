### **What Does Matrix Merge Mean?**

“Merging matrices” usually means **combining two or more matrices** either:
✅ **Horizontally** (side by side → adding columns)
or
✅ **Vertically** (stacked → adding rows)

---

### **1️⃣ Horizontal Merge (Column-wise merge)**

You combine matrices side by side, so:

* Both matrices must have **the same number of rows**.
* The result will have **the same number of rows** and **sum of columns**.

**Example:**

```
A (2×2)        B (2×3)
[1 2]          [7 8 9]
[3 4]          [10 11 12]

Merged (2×5):
[1 2 7 8 9]
[3 4 10 11 12]
```

---

### **2️⃣ Vertical Merge (Row-wise merge)**

You stack matrices on top of each other, so:

* Both matrices must have **the same number of columns**.
* The result will have **sum of rows** and **same number of columns**.

**Example:**

```
A (2×3)
[1 2 3]
[4 5 6]

B (1×3)
[7 8 9]

Merged (3×3):
[1 2 3]
[4 5 6]
[7 8 9]
```

### **Steps for Merging Matrices**

✅ **Horizontal Merge**

* For each row `i`, concatenate row `A[i]` with row `B[i]`.

✅ **Vertical Merge**

* Combine all rows of A, followed by all rows of B.

---

### **Things to Check**

* Horizontal → same row count.
* Vertical → same column count.

If dimensions don’t match, you **cannot merge** without resizing or padding.

---

### **Optimized or Special Cases**

* If you work with **sparse matrices**, use sparse data formats to avoid combining large zero blocks.
* For very large matrices, process row by row or block by block instead of loading everything into memory.
* In image processing, matrix merge is often called **concatenation** or **tiling**.
