## ðŸ“˜ Theory: Finding the Missing Number in an Array

### ðŸ”¹ Objective:

To find a **single missing number** in an array containing `n - 1` distinct integers from the range `1` to `n`.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Core Idea:

If we know the sum of the first `n` natural numbers, and we subtract the sum of the given array from it, the result will be the missing number.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Formula Used:

To find the sum of first `n` natural numbers:

```
Sum = n * (n + 1) / 2
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ Steps Involved:

1. Calculate the **expected total sum** from `1` to `n` using the formula.
2. Calculate the **actual sum** of the elements in the array using a loop.
3. Subtract the actual sum from the total sum to get the **missing number**.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Example:

For input array `{1, 2, 4, 5, 6}`
The expected sequence is from `1` to `6`
Expected total sum = `21`
Actual array sum = `18`
**Missing number = 21 - 18 = 3**

---

### ðŸ”¹ Efficiency:

* **Time Complexity:** O(n) â€” one pass through the array
* **Space Complexity:** O(1) â€” no extra space used
